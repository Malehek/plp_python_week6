## Analyzing Data with Pandas and Visualizing Results with Matplotlib
## Description

## Objective For this Assignment:

To load and analyze a dataset using the pandas library in Python.
To create simple plots and charts with the matplotlib library for visualizing the data.

## Submission Requirements

Submit a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) or Python script (.py file) containing:
Data loading and exploration steps.
Basic data analysis results.
Visualizations.
Any findings or observations.

## Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset 

Choose a dataset in CSV format (for example, you can use datasets like the Iris dataset, a sales dataset, or any dataset of your choice).
Load the dataset using pandas.
Display the first few rows of the dataset using .head() to inspect the data.
Explore the structure of the dataset by checking the data types and any missing values.
Clean the dataset by either filling or dropping any missing values.

## Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
Compute the basic statistics of the numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) using .describe().
Perform groupings on a categorical column (for example, species, region, or department) and compute the mean of a numerical column for each group.
Identify any patterns or interesting findings from your analysis
